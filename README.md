# Parallel-Group

This project aims to construct a PDE solver using a adaptive resolution grid. The main language used is Julia in a jupyter notebook environment

## Requirements to run
1. Vscode, with the julia and jupyter notebook extensions
2. Julia 1.8.3 installed

## Environment setup
Once the git repo is downloaded, open a terminal in the JuliaCode directory, and run the following

```shell
julia
```
Press "]" to enter package mode and then enter
``` julia
activate .
```

This should install the required packages and setup the correct environment

## Run
Open the notebook in VScode, make sure the kernel is set to a Julia kernel, and that the environment set in the lower left corner is not the julia default environment, but the project environment. Then you can simply run all blocks and see the results.
